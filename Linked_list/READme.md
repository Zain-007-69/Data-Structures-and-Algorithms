# **Linked List:**

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size, and the memory allocation for nodes can be dynamic. Linked lists provide a flexible way to organize and manage data.

## **Components of a Linked List:**

- **Node:** Each element in a linked list is called a node. A node contains data and a reference (or a link) to the next node.

- **Head:** The first node in the linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point for traversing the list.

- **Tail:** The last node in the linked list is called the tail. In a singly linked list, the tail's next reference is typically null, while in a doubly linked list, it points to the previous node.

## **Working of Linked List:**

1. **Creation:**
   - Nodes are created dynamically as needed.
   - Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Traversing a linked list involves starting from the head and moving through each node until the end (where the next reference is null).

3. **Insertion:**
   - Nodes can be inserted at the beginning (prepend), end (append), or in the middle.
   - Updating references ensures proper connections.

4. **Deletion:**
   - Nodes can be deleted from any position in the linked list.
   - Adjusting references is necessary to maintain the integrity of the list.

5. **Searching:**
   - Linear search is performed by traversing the list until the desired node is found.
   - Searching is generally slower compared to arrays due to the lack of direct indexing.

### **Types of Linked Lists:**

1. **Singly Linked List:**
   - Each node points to the next node.
   - Simple and memory-efficient.

2. **Doubly Linked List:**
   - Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
   - Allows for easy traversal in both directions.

3. **Circular Linked List:**
   - Similar to a singly or doubly linked list, but the last node points back to the first node (for circular singly linked lists) or the last node points to the first, and the first node points to the last (for circular doubly linked lists).

4. **Doubly Circular Linked List:**
   - Combines the features of a doubly linked list with those of a circular linked list.
   - Each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes, and the last node points back to the first node.

5. **Skip List:**
   - A modified linked list with multiple layers of linked lists.
   - Allows for faster search operations compared to simple linked lists.

### **Advantages of Linked Lists:**

1. **Dynamic Size:**
   - Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, allowing for efficient memory utilization.

2. **Ease of Insertion and Deletion:**
   - Adding or removing elements is relatively easier than in arrays, especially in the middle of the list.

3. **No Wasted Memory:**
   - Memory is allocated as needed, avoiding the need for a fixed-size allocation.

### **Disadvantages of Linked Lists:**

1. **Random Access:**
   - Lack of direct indexing makes random access and search less efficient compared to arrays.

2. **Extra Memory:**
   - Requires extra memory for storing references/pointers.

3. **Traversal Overhead:**
   - Traversing a linked list takes linear time, making some operations slower.

In summary, linked lists are versatile data structures with different types suited for various applications. The choice of the type of linked list depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. While they offer advantages in terms of dynamic size and easy insertion/deletion, considerations such as memory usage and traversal efficiency should be taken into account when choosing a data structure for a particular task.
